## Conway's Game of Life
This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. It uses the pygame library to display the game and render the updates. 

# Usage
To run the game, simply clone this repository, run the following commands in the terminal:
```
pip install pygame
python gameOfLife.py
```

# Controls
* Left click to toggle a cell's state
* Right click to toggle the game's state
* Press 'r' to reset the game
* Press 'q' to quit the game

# Rules of the Game
The rules of the game are as follows:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
